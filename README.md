# Go Alethio API client (golang wrapper for API)

| WARNING: This is currently a WIP, not ready for production |
| --- |

This repo is an unofficial set of API wrappers for the [Alethio API definition](https://api.aleth.io/v1/docs) written in Golang

Testing and light use is free. If heavier use, get an API key [here](https://developers.aleth.io/)

The key is imported via environment variables, so be sure to set it via the command:

`export ALETHIO_APIKEY="your_api_key"`

Structure is modeled after [go-github API client](https://github.com/google/go-github)
